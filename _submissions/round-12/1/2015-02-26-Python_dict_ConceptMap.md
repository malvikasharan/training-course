When i started to learn Python few years ago, I remember I was not very familier with the concept of dictionary and avoided to use it, I decided to map out the so I decided to draw a concept map of built-in properties of dict (the properties from collections.defaultdict is not included).

Here is built in properties and methos of python mapping type container, dictionary.

It shows the built-in methods of dictionary in python.
<code>
SELECT <i>field_name, field_name</i> FROM <i>table_name</i>;
</code>
